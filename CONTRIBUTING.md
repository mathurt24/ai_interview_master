- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Validate input data using Zod schemas
- Maintain database schema consistency

### Database Changes
- Use Drizzle ORM for all database operations
- Update schema definitions in `shared/schema.ts`
- Run `npm run db:push` to apply changes
- Test with both PostgreSQL and fallback systems

## Testing

### Manual Testing
- Test complete interview flow (upload â†’ questions â†’ answers â†’ results)
- Verify voice interface functionality
- Test admin dashboard statistics and data
- Check mobile responsiveness
- Validate error handling scenarios

### AI System Testing
